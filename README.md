### How to calculate the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of a given pair of numbers.
#### Greatest Common Divisor
##### Greatest common divisor of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4. It is also know and highest common factor. 
##### A example of Greatest common divisor is using these numbers: 10 44 33 27 19 55 87
##### I will show you how to work out the GCD:
```10 = 2×5

44 = 22×11

33 = 3×11

27 = 33

19 = 19

55 = 5×11

87 = 3×29

GCD = 1```

#### Least Common Divisor




### Arithmetic and Geometric progressions
##### The code below is a working sum that can do arithmetic and geometric progressions:
```#include <iostream> /*Libary*/
#include <time.h>


using namespace std;

int main () {
  
int input;

cout << "Enter a number" << "\n";

cin >> input;

int geometric = input + input;

int geometric2 = geometric + input;

int geometric3 = geometric2 + input;

cout << "Geometric Number: " "\n";
cout << geometric << "\n";
cout << geometric2 << "\n";
cout << geometric3 << "\n";
}
```
